Plan to understand the design

    Pull the designs into FigJam so they're easier to work with. Done
    Inspect the design in both Mobile and Desktop, think it through holistically.
    Start to break down the design by drawing on it and naming the parts (guide on how to break down a design into components: https://www.seancdavis.com/posts/breaking-down-design-into-components/)Feel free to delete this and start from scratch.
